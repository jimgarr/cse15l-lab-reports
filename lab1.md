# Lab Report 1
## Description
This lab report includes how to download Visual Studio Code, how to connect to the remote access computer using ssh, and then using some commands once connected.

## Downloading Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is what is used to connect to the remote computer so we have to download it first before attemtping to connect. If you don't already have VSCode installed, go to the link at [VSCode Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the installation instructions. Once downloaded, open a window that should look like the following image.

You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. Your post should include all the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked like. You’re free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones. Complete any steps you didn’t complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 3 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include at least 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did. If for some reason you didn’t do the step exactly, describe why not (maybe your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked differently, etc).
